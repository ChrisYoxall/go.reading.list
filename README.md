# go.reading.list

This is an example of Go web service and application that uses a Postgres database.

Taken from the Pluralsight course 'Building Go Web Services and Applications' by Josh Duffney


## Postgres Database ##

Run Postgres in Docker: docker run --name reading-list-db-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres

Shell into Postgres container: docker exec -it reading-list-db-container /bin/bash

Connect to Postgress instance (likely not prompted for password inside container): psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres

Create database: CREATE DATABASE readinglist;

Create new user so don't need superuser password: CREATE ROLE readinglist WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'pa55w0rd';

Change to the 'readinglist' database: \c readinglist

Create table: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (
                id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
                created_at timestamp(0) with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
                title text NOT NULL,
                published integer NOT NULL,
                pages integer NOT NULL,
                genres text[] NOT NULL,
                rating real NOT NULL,
                version integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1);

Grant the 'readinglist' user access to the table: GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE books TO readinglist;

As using 'bigserial' type  for 'id' need sequence permissions: GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE books_id_seq TO readinglist;

Set environment variable with dsn: export READINGLIST_DB_DSN 'postgres://readinglist:pa55w0rd@localhost:5432/readinglist?sslmode=disable'

Also remember to import the 'database/sql' and 'github.com/lib/pq' (will need go get github.com/lib/pq) packages.
